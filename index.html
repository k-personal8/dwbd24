            <h2>The Most Special Letter for the Most Special Person in the World</h2>
            <p>
                My beautiful, perfect, sweet, funny, loving, cutie patootie, kind (goose) Devanshi,

                HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY JOYFUL EUPHORIC BIRTHDAYYYYYYY!!!!!

I remember 366 days ago like it was yesterday. I sat down, laptop opened, and I just thought about the most special person in my life during my favorite time of the year, a time to reflect on the most important people in my life over the past year. I have to thank every god in the world for allowing the incredibly lucky me to meet the most special person this universe has ever met, Devanshi Girish Wable!!! Although we were still friends at that point, my heart skipped a beat every time I heard your name, saw a text from you, or a picture of you from anyone. 

Now, I didn't get to start the year with you, but I do get to end the year with you, and that makes me the luckiest man in the world. Saying I love you for the first time was scary for me, it was the first time that I've gone out of my way to express how special someone is to me with an I Love You that I have meant from the deepest parts of my heart. But, I don't regret a single moment that has passed since because I truly do love you my little Deva! In my hardest moments, happiest moments, saddest moments, angriest moments, loneliest moments, every single moment, I can only think about you, and that beautiful smile. Oh my god I could write on and on about how beautiful your smile is to me. I have always been a person that likes to see other people smile because it makes me feel like I am worthy because I brought joy to someone else. But I have never seen a smile that has made me smile until I saw yours. Even when we were friends, and we were sitting on your bed at SSTP, I remember I just couldn't stop smiling at you when you were laughing or telling a joke, oh how I wish I could see that smile again for the first time. You know that even at my lowest point that smile is the only thing in the world that can pull me out of spiraling. That smile means so much to me now because it represents the most important thing in the world to me, your happiness. 

I will make it my life's goal to forever keep you happy, from a simple smile that you get when you see me coming out of the terminal to see you, from however far, whenever I can, to a big laugh that we both have, watching TikToks together, a laugh so infectious that I even fall off my bed LMAO. This year has been full of laughs and cries, and I'm so so so so so so so so so so so sorry my love for all the times something that I have or haven't done has made you cry, because just as important and meaningful as your smile is to me, seeing and hearing you cry hurts my soul even more. I'm sorry for the long distance, I'm sorry for not being a good listener, I'm sorry for not validating you enough because you are the ONLY person in the world who deserves to be pampered with love 24/7/366,  I'm sorry for not telling you how much I miss you and I love you every day, I'm sorry for keeping you up so late every night, I'm sorry for becoming such a big part of your life that your happiness depends on mine. But... am I really sorry? Mmmm yes mostly to the bad stuff that I do but not really anything else. 100 times out of 10 I will choose all the time I spent talking to you over doing anything else. Sleep is a refresher but baby you are what brings me to life. Without you, I am dull, I am gray, and I am unhappy with the world. I love you so incredibly much, I could be sorry for everything I have to give to this world but I will never be sorry for how much I love you. 

Thank you for sitting with me as I finish my multi homework until 7 am in the morning, thank you for sitting on the ground with me, watching Netflix as we down some cold pizza from Mama's Too, thank you for cleaning my room to the very last speck of dust and making my bed just the way I like it when I am taking an exam, thank you for giving me good morning kisses to wake me up even when I get frustrated that I'm being disturbed in my sleep but it's you so I don't know what to do about it lol, thank you for texting me a bajillion things when I am asleep so I can feel like I'm with you all the time, thank you for picking up my calls in the change room to check out my outfits, thank you for sleeping on the phone with me every night, thank you for waking up early to drive anywhere to take a flight to see me, thank you for buying me cute gifts (I really really really liked the bracelet you gave me that let me see a picture of us if I looked closely at it, I would look at it every single minute if it still worked), thank you for pushing me out of my comfort zone to grow as a person, thank you for teaching me how to lock in and focus for my exams, thank you for teaching me to become a good communicator, thank you for resolving any argument we have with love and compassion, thank you for enduring two of the hardest months of long distance with the most BANNOYING guy in the world, thank you for waking up early in the morning to watch a sunrise with me to just end up snoozing together in a random Orlando Publix parking lot LOL, thank you for driving me everywhere (I will forever be your passenger princess, I'll let you be my napping princess), thank you for taking me to your favorite rides in your favorite childhood theme park, thank you for giving me the luxury of experiencing a road-trip with my girlfriend, thank you for coming to Toronto to visit me, thank you for being so excited to meet my friends, thank you for being so open to try my favorite foods with me, thank you for going along with my crazy day plans, thank you for looking at me so lovingly all the time, thank you for telling your stories (they are like art to me the way you make the most mundane small events sound like the most interesting thing to me), thank you for cuddling with me in AMCs, you make every movie more interesting to me, thank you for coming to my favorite childhood theme park and loving all the rides, thank you for waiting in line with me for everything (I've never been more patient to wait than I am when I get to spend it talking to you and looking into those beautiful brown eyes), thank you for beating me at bowling (It has always been the most memorable moment of all our trips when I remember back to Pinstripes in Miami and sitting next to you but not knowing what to do, I really wish I had just kissed you then for the first time), thank you for loving me and missing my presence so much you start crying (just like I do), thank you for writing letters to me every month to document your love for me, thank you for always giving me the first bite now, thank you for being the happiest little girl when I try my best to send you the prettiest bouquets in the world, thank you for doing my laundry even though it's your least favorite chore in the whole world, thank you for rushing around and speed walking with me everywhere even though you hate being in a rush and under a time crunch, thank you for letting me eat your half of everything from Chef Mike's to Chipotle, thank you for being so proud to call me your boyfriend in front of whoever, whenever, thank you for thinking the same things that I am thinking at the same time (we are always telepathically connected), thank you for doing rollercoaster with me, thank you for being so excited to talk to me even after 17 months of FaceTime's, thank you for working so hard everywhere: in school, in the gym, in the kitchen, everywhere to better yourself so that I get to reap the benefits of a wonderful, hard-working girlfriend and lǎo pó, thank you for helping me find the silver lining when all seems to be going wrong, thank you for sticking by my side through all the bad days and tougher nights in Gainesville, thank you for being everything a little childhood Ken could ever dream for in a girlfriend, in a soulmate, in a partner for life.

I don't know how the world could deserve a soul so special, so bright, and so enlightening as yours, especially to all the fake hoes who are mean to you (fuck them and their sad lonely miserable boring ass, jealous lives), please keep loving yourself just as much as I love you and you love me. You are so deserving of everything good this world has to offer, please don't ever sell yourself short. I know you'll just think that I'm saying this because I'm your boyfriend but I'm serious baby you have the capability to change the lives of everyone around you for the better because I know it and I have seen how special you are more than anyone else has ever been able to. I will be your best friend for the rest of your life, I will be there to listen to you complain all the way from your Chem professor to your hospital administrators, to cry with you, to laugh with you, to experience the best parts of life together with you. You asked me in March this year why I was so sure that you're the one, and I don't really remember what I said but I know it was along the lines of the fact that you have made me feel a feeling that I've never felt with anyone else, love, and now, to be honest I feel like that wasn't a good answer because we had only known each other and dated each other for such a small amount of time, but now, 300 days have passed and I have truly understood why I love you. Love to me isn't about grand gestures, or life-changing moments that make me fall in love you, to me, it's about how I wake up every morning and even before I can open my eyes I see a picture of you in my head. It's about the little moments that we share with each other, up way past our bed time, laughing about the dumbest things or just studying together on the phone. It's about sticking with you through everything because what is life without the only person who makes it more than bearable, something to look forward to everyday. It's about the little smiles and longing stares that we share with each other even at our hardest times. My definition of love is all about you, Devanshi.

I'm soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo glad we didn't decide to just be low-maintenance long distance best friends and instead we are everything I could've hoped for. I am super duper excited to go into 2025 with the girl I fell madly in love with in 2024! I LOVE YOU DEVANSHI !!!

(P.S. I remember the 4000 dollars I owe you, don't think I forgot it, I have only been paying you in flowers and uggs and gifts and hugs and kisses, maybe one day the bank will finally let me withdraw those 4000 dollars but for now I guess your only present is me this year...)

(P.S. to the P.S. I had planned for this to be like 1610 words but then I couldn't stop writing when I started writing about why I love you so I kept going to 1975 which is 1609+366 but then I forgot a lot of reasons why I need to thank you that I just couldn't leave out because I want to pour my heart out so that you can finally understand why you mean so much to me even though you don't see it yourself so yea that is how we are at 2148 words LMAO)

                Love forever and always,
                Your Ken(nedy)
